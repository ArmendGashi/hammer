# Hammer

A Node.js, Express, MySQL, Passport, Jade starter kit.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/jkup/hammer.git
    cd hammer
    npm install

### MySQL

First you'll need to create a database, name it anything you'd like but you'll need the name later.

Inside this database create a "users" table that contains the following fields:

    id       ( INT, Auto Incrementing, Primary Key )
    username ( VARCHAR )
    email    ( VARCHAR )
    password ( VARCHAR )

You'll then need to edit app/config/connection.js and enter your credentials.

    const connection = mysql.createConnection({
      host     : 'localhost',
      user     : 'YOUR_USERNAME',
      password : 'YOUR_PASSWORD',
      database : 'YOUR_DATABASE'
    });

### Server

Now you can edit app/config/routes/default-routes.js and replace the title and message key with whatever you'd like to see as the home page title and header message.

### Start

Now just run:

    node .

And off you go!
